Get Next Line Function

Overview 📚

get_next_line() is a function designed to read a line from a file descriptor. It handles multiple file descriptors and efficiently returns lines without losing the reading state of each descriptor.

Features 🚀

Reads from a file descriptor line-by-line.
Supports multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
Manages dynamic memory allocation to build lines progressively.
Handles edge cases such as EOF and errors gracefully.
How to Use 🛠️

Call get_next_line(fd) with an open file descriptor fd.
The function returns a line each time it is called until the end of the file is reached.
Ensure that fd is valid and the file is opened in the appropriate mode.
My Experience 🌟

This project was built as part of my studies and exploration of C programming. It strengthened my understanding of:
File handling in C, including working with file descriptors.
Memory management, dynamic allocation, and using static variables.
Implementing algorithms that require state retention across function calls.
Handling edge cases and optimizing code for reliability.
Important Notes ⚠️

The function uses read() to read data from the file descriptor.
A static variable is used to maintain state across function calls.
Limitations 🚫
The function does not handle files larger than available memory.
